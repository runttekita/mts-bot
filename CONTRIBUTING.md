1) download and install [Modded Spire Exporter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2069872611&searchtext=exporter) mod and run its export process with the desired mod installed.

2) Find the desired mod's `items.json` created by the exporter and rename it to be the same as your mod's mod id. Make sure the file name is all lowercase.

3) Fork this repository and place that file in the `data` folder, and then open a pull request.
